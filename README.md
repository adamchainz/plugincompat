# pytest-plugs #

Test execution and compatibility checks for pytest plugins. 

![plug](static/electrical-plug-th.png)

The purpose of this project is to provide a web page to
check known python and pytest compatibility for plugins.

## Status ##

Right now we have a [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/nicoddemus/pytest-plugs) build matrix 
that checks if plugins work against several python and pytest versions.

This is a work in progress, of course. :)
